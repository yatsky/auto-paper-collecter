## 🆕 What's New

> **2026-06-26 · Added an Agent Skill version** 🤖
>
> Besides the web app, the repo now ships a **Claude Code / Codex–compatible Agent Skill** ([`skill/`](skill/)).
> Just say **"run my paper radar"** and it runs the whole pipeline and produces today's digest ——
> **pure Python stdlib, zero dependencies, no AI API key** (the model running the skill does the query
> expansion / relevance filtering / summaries / hot-topics itself).
> 👉 See the **"🤖 Use as an Agent Skill"** section below and [`skill/SKILL.md`](skill/SKILL.md).

## 🌟 What is this

**auto-paper-collecter** is a lightweight, self-hosted **academic-paper aggregator**.

Tell it a few keywords you care about, and every day it automatically:

> 🛰️ Searches across **arXiv / Crossref (incl. IEEE·ACM) / Semantic Scholar / GitHub / RSS**
> 🧠 Uses an **LLM for "associative" query expansion** — not just literal keyword matching
> 🎯 Uses an **LLM to filter out off-domain / irrelevant papers** — keeping only on-topic CS work
> ✍️ Writes a **summary** for each (one-line TL;DR / method / key contributions)
> 📊 Analyzes **hot topics**, generates **weekly reports**, and **emails / browser-notifies** you

A zero-build single-page dashboard, same-origin front + back, ready out of the box.

> Note: the dashboard UI and built-in summaries default to Chinese — adapt the prompts/templates for other languages.

---

## 🎯 Motivation

> [!NOTE]
> One of the most tiring parts of research is **keeping up with the literature**.
> arXiv adds hundreds of papers a day; keyword search either misses synonymous phrasings or drowns you
> in cross-domain noise. Doing it by hand is slow and easy to miss things.

So this little tool **automates** "reading the latest papers every day", and hands the two dirtiest jobs to an LLM:

1. **Think broader**: `C2Rust` should also match `C-to-Rust translation`, `migrating legacy C code to Rust`…
2. **Filter sharper**: keep out same-name cross-domain noise like *translation* in medicine or *AI* in finance.

So when you open the page, you see **a clean, time-sorted, summarized daily feed**. 🫧

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1) Clone & enter
git clone https://github.com/PenghaoJiang/auto-paper-collecter.git
cd auto-paper-collecter

# 2) venv & deps
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate            # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3) Configure (copy the template, then edit .env with your AI gateway etc.)
cp .env.example .env

# 4) Take off 🛫
python run.py
```

Open **http://localhost:8000** → go to "Settings" to add keywords → click "Save & Fetch".

> [!TIP]
> Use **English** keywords (higher recall across sources). The first fetch + summaries take ~1–3 min in the background; the page updates automatically when done.

---

## 🤖 Use as an Agent Skill

Besides the web app, the repo ships a **Claude Code / Codex–compatible Agent Skill** (the [`skill/`](skill/) directory) —
just tell your AI assistant **"run my paper radar"** and it runs the whole pipeline and produces today's digest,
with **no AI API key needed** (the model running the skill *is* the LLM).

```bash
# Install: copy skill/ into your Claude Code skills directory
cp -r skill ~/.claude/skills/auto-paper-collecter
# Edit your keywords
$EDITOR ~/.claude/skills/auto-paper-collecter/state/config.json
```

Then tell Claude Code **"run my paper radar / what's new today"**. The scripts are **pure Python stdlib, zero-dep**;
deterministic fetching is done by the scripts, while the LLM judgement (expansion / relevance filter / summaries /
hot-topics) is done by the model running the skill (Claude Code → Claude; Codex → GPT). See [`skill/SKILL.md`](skill/SKILL.md).

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Everything lives in `.env` (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|:--:|---|
| `AI_BASE_URL` / `AI_API_KEY` / `AI_MODEL` | ✅ | Any **OpenAI-compatible** gateway. With `AI_ENABLED=false` it falls back to raw summaries and skips the LLM |
| `SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_KEY` | ⬜ | Optional; works without one, just stricter rate limits |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | ⬜ | Optional; raises the GitHub search rate limit |
| `SMTP_*` / `EMAIL_*` | ⬜ | Optional; the scheduler emails the daily digest (Gmail needs an **App Password**) |
| `REFRESH_TIMES` / `TIMEZONE` | ⬜ | Daily refresh times & timezone (default `10:00,22:00` / `Asia/Shanghai`) |
| `BACKFILL_N` / `RSS_FEEDS` | ⬜ | Backfill count / academic-news RSS feeds |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `.env` is gitignored — **your keys are never committed**. Keep them safe 🔐
